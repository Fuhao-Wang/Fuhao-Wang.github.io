I am an assistant professor in School of Data Science at Fudan University. I got my Ph.D. degree from Guanghua School of Management, Peking University in 2017. After that I worked as a postdoctoral research assistant in Department of Statistics, Penn State University during 2017-2018. My research interests are mainly on network/spatial data modelling and business statistics.
