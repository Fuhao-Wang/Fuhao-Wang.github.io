I am an assistant professor in [School of Data Science](http://www.sds.fudan.edu.cn/wp/) at Fudan University. I got my Ph.D. degree from [Guanghua School of Management, Peking University](http://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn/) in 2017. After that I worked as a postdoctoral research assistant in [Department of Statistics, Penn State University](http://stat.psu.edu/) during 2017-2018. My research interests are mainly on network/spatial data modelling and business statistics.
